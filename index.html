          Wearing masks reduces COVID-19 transmission and saves lives.
        </h2>
        <p>
          Large bodies of research show that masks reduce transmission of viruses, and that reusable homemade cloth masks are quite effective.

          Wear a mask when you need to go outside. 
        </h2>
        <p>
          The most important thing to do right now is stay home and reduce the spread. When you need to go out to places like the grocery store, wear your reusable mask to reduce the chance of infection between you and others.

          Wearing masks protects you, and everyone else too.
        </h2>
        <p>
          When you wear a mask, you reduce your exposure to COVID-19. You also protect others, because wearing a mask helps keep you from transmitting the virus on accident. We want 100% of the population to wear masks when they go outside.

          Wear a cloth mask. Save disposable masks for healthcare workers.
        </h2>
        <p>
          Masks like N95 and surgical masks are in short supply. Medical workers need these special masks due to their extended exposure. A simple cloth mask will provide all the protection most people need.

          Who should be wearing masks?
        </h2>
        <p>
          Everybody. We want 100% of the population wearing masks when they're outside their home.
        </p>
        <p>
          When just you wear a mask, you protect yourself. When everybody wears a mask, they protect themselves and each other. All societies that are successfully managing the virus have had widespread mask usage be a part of their success strategy.

          How can we live a normal life with the virus still around?
        </h2>
        <p>
          A vaccine for COVID-19 is at least 12-18 months away. It may take longer. Until then, our options are to keep staying inside forever, or to get control of the virus.
        </p>
        <p>
          Many countries are managing COVID-19 well, including Singapore, Taiwan, the Czech Republic, and Mongolia. Things that all of these countries are doing are:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>widespread testing</strong> - everyone with symptoms is tested
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>contact tracing</strong> - when someone gets COVID-19, anyone with recent and extended exposure to them is identified and tested
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>quarantining the sick</strong> - those with COVID-19 are made to stay home
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>widespread wearing of masks</strong> - when people aren't at home, they wear masks
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          The virus is already out of control in many communities, so we need to stay inside and get the numbers back down. Once we do, following the example they've pioneered will help us get back to our work and normal social life faster.

          Where can I get a cloth mask?
        </h2>
        <p>
          The fastest way is to make one yourself. You don't even need to know how to sew - you can make one with a T-shirt and a safety pin. Here's a couple of videos, depending on how you want to craft it:

            The super easy one. No sewing required, and it comes with some instructions on how to clean it too: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hVEVve-3QeM&t=6m46s">Why we need #Masks4All, and how to make your own mask</a>

          <strong>Buy a mask now, or make a plan to get one now.</strong> While you're waiting for your mask, you can try things like wrapping a scarf over your face. Any coverage you can give your nose and mouth helps.
        </p>
        <p>
          If you do decide to make a mask, consider making a few extra to share with your friends, family, neighbors, or community.

          Won't I look funny if I'm the only one wearing a mask?
        </h2>
        <p>
          We want 100% of people to wear masks in public. If your community doesn't have many people wearing masks yet, <strong>you have an opportunity to save lives and help people</strong> by setting an example in your community.
        </p>
        <p>
          When you wear a cloth mask, nobody can accuse you of taking the supply from medical workers. If you make your own mask, pick a fabric that's fun and suits your personality.
        </p>
        <p>
          When enough people start wearing masks, the people who don't wear them will be the ones that look funny. You'll look like someone who was ahead of the curve for wearing one first.

          Shouldn't we save medical masks for healthcare workers?
        </h2>
        <p>
          You're right! Disposable medical masks like N95 and surgical masks are in short supply. We hope all governments are taking this threat seriously, and are working hard to increase medical mask production. For now, save them for the medical workers and use a cloth mask.

        <h2>
          Won't I still get some exposure if I wear a mask?
        </h2>
        <p>
          When you do get exposed to COVID-19, you want the amount of exposure to be small. When the body is exposed to the virus, the immune response kicks in and you start making antibodies to protect you from the virus. If you get exposed to a smaller amount, your body has more time to build a good defense before the virus multiplies too much in your body. It means you're much less likely to get seriously ill or die from the virus.
        </p>
        <p>
          Masks significantly reduce exposure to COVID-19. You can protect yourself by lowering your exposure and wearing a mask. If everybody in your community wears a mask, the amount of exposure is even lower since you're protected at both ends. The lower the exposure, the better.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div class="faq-section">
        <h2>
          Why do healthcare workers need N95 masks and I don't?
        </h2>
        <p>
          There are two main reasons: the amount of exposure, and the types of exposure.
        </p>
        <p>
          Medical personnel are likely to have much greater contact to the virus than the general public since they are constantly exposed to people with COVID-19.
        </p>
        <p>
          Medical professionals are also much more likely to be around the virus in aerosolized, airborne form due to the sort of procedures they perform. Your exposure is more likely to be from contact (touching a surface with the virus and then touching your face), or droplets (people around you talking, laughing coughing, etc.) While droplets and airborne sound the same, they're not. Airborne COVID-19 is more likely to come from procedures like surgery, intubation, and high-speed dental drilling. Airborne particles are much smaller, and N95 masks offer much better protection to them. If you aren't doing these sorts of procedures, you probably aren't going to be exposed to much aerosolized COVID-19.

        <h2>
          What if my government told me not to wear masks?
        </h2>
        <p>
          Your government is rightfully trying to protect the supply of N95 and surgical masks for healthcare workers. <strong>You should listen to your government's advice and not buy or hold disposable N95 and surgical masks.</strong>
        </p>
        <p>
          Unfortunately, we believe your government is wrong if they are saying masks do not reduce the spread. Many governments around the world are encouraging or mandating mask use to reduce the spread, in both Asia and Europe. Your government may change its advice when the supply of masks goes up. Until then, <strong>please use a reusable cloth mask.</strong>
